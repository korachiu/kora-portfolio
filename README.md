The attached code is the portfolio website I created for myself. I've always wondered what it would be like to code a website, and this was my opportunity to explore that. I wanted to understand web development as part of my professional practice—especially if I decide to pursue the UI/UX route.

I included pages such as:

Work – to display both my graphic design and illustrative work,
About – to share information about myself,
Resume – so people can easily access my professional experience and education,
Contact – where users can enter their name and email if they’re interested in working with me, and
a fun Bill the Duck page – where I feature my playful duck drawings and animations.
I’m most proud of my navigation bar. I struggled a lot with its layout—it involved a lot of trial and error—but I eventually got it to stay fixed at the top of the website. That way, no matter where a user scrolls, they have easy access to the rest of my pages.

To be honest, I’m proud of my website as a whole. Coding is very challenging for me and probably something I’ll never fully understand, as my brain just doesn’t seem wired that way. But I’m genuinely proud of the work I did, the research I conducted, and everything I learned in class.

The hardest part of coding my website was bridging the gap between my design vision and my actual coding skills. I was ambitious with the design and had a clear vision in mind, but my coding limitations forced me to adapt and change that vision. Because of this, I had to do a lot of independent research, revisit previous assignments, and rewatch lectures to bring my ideas to life.

In the end, even though the final website didn’t fully meet my original design goals, I learned so much throughout the process—and I can now confidently say I know how to read HTML and CSS code.
